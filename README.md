# Utilities
Primary Utility Tools

This is a repository of our primary utility classes that we internally use.

## Features
The primary use-case for this library, is for two things: Common utility classes, and databases.

We have a custom Database system that allows use to use a single type of function for any type of the following databases:

-  Cassandra/ScyllaDB
-  MySQL/MariaDB
-  SQLite

We can easily hook into this system to add other database types as well, as long as we need them, and their syntax is somewhat similar to that of SQL.

## Issues
If you notice any issues with the library, feel free to submit an Issue on Github, or submit a Pull Request with your fixes.
